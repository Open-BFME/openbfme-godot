# BFME1 support

BFME1 is an experimental, separate game mode. It uses a BFME1 installation for
both menus and gameplay, without mixing in BFME2 or RotWK data.

From the checkout root on **Linux or macOS (POSIX shell)**, with a matching
Godot 4.7 editor binary on `PATH`, the GDExtension already built into
`godot/bin/`, and BFME1 data in `games/BFME1`, launch:

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="$PWD/games/BFME1" godot --path godot -- --game=bfme1
```

Alternatively pass `--bfme1-install="$PWD/games/BFME1"` alongside `--game=bfme1`.
Replace the folder relative to the checkout with your installation; `$PWD`
resolves it before Godot changes its working directory. On **Windows cmd.exe**, use
`build.bat` with MSVC/Ninja first, then run the Godot 4.7 console executable
with `--path godot -- --game=bfme1 --bfme1-install="%CD%/games/BFME1"`; the POSIX
environment-variable prefix above is not Windows command syntax.
The installation must contain its BIG archives, including `apt` and `lang`.
Installed patch archives are included in BFME1 archive order; launcher-generated
`!!!` graphics overrides are excluded and named in the mount report (`excluded_archives`). This mode fingerprints the installed
archives for content identity, but does not certify them against a retail 1.03
manifest. The existing RotWK verification policy is unchanged.

The launcher offers **Battle for Middle-earth I** in the Play screen's game selector
and passes the asset folder when starting BFME1 (`BFME1_INSTALL`, a remembered
`BFME1_INSTALL=` in the game's `install-paths.cfg`, `downloaded-installs.cfg`
or `downloaded-bfme1.cfg`, the default games folder's `BFME1`, or an existing
macOS AIO installation). The command-line equivalent is `--game=bfme1 --play` on
the launcher; the selection persists. With **Battle for Middle-earth I** chosen,
**Game files** offers an OPTIONAL download of BFME1 1.03 (the `original-BFME1`
package, from BFME Arena / bfmeladder.com, a third party: OpenBFME does not host
it); it goes into `<folder>/BFME1` and is found from then on
([AIO.md](AIO.md#bfme1-optional-community-pr-36-restored-2026-10-18), "BFME1 (optional)").

BFME1 has separate `bfme1-Options.ini` and `bfme1-Skirmish.ini` settings.
`--game=bfme1` and `--bfme1-install=...` are normal player options, so profiles persist between launches.
Automation flags such as `--auto` still use an isolated temporary profile file.
Its archive fingerprint cache is `bfme1-archive-cache.cfg` in the user data folder.

## Source and implementation

The BFME1 donor was inspected at `77b050212e`. Keep a local reference checkout
under `workspace/reference/open-bfme-1`; paths below are relative to that
donor, not this checkout. Relevant sources:

- `game/GameEngineDevice/Source/Win32Device/Common/Win32BIGFileSystem_loadBigFiles.cpp`:
  descending archive order, first archive wins.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/GameClient/GameText.cpp`, `parseCSF` at `0x00437570`:
  complemented UTF-16 strings, first string per label, optional voice records.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/GameClient/GUI/AptMainMenuConstructor.cpp` and
  `BfmeAptScreenMainMenuProvider.cpp`: BFME1 menu commands and providers.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/Common/Thing/ThingTemplate.cpp` and
  `GameClient/Drawable/Behavior/RandomSoundSelectorFieldParse.cpp`:
  legacy object and voice fields.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/Common/INI/INIAudioSettings.cpp` and
  `GameClient/Eva.cpp`: BFME1 audio settings and predefined EVA names.

The shared engine reads BFME1's subsystem legend and omits expansion-only
Stances/Create-a-Hero initialization. Language files under `lang/english` are
exposed at the root, as expected by existing menu readers. Both the shell and
in-game text consumers understand CSF.

## Isolation

BFME1 support never changes RotWK / BFME2 behaviour (community PR #36 review). `Common/BfmeGame.h`:

- **Which game:** `isBfme1Data(fs)` (BFME1's `SubsystemLegend.ini` without
  `SubsystemLegendExpansion1.ini` or BFME2's `AwardSystem.ini`), cached per INI
  environment (`INIEnvironment::bfme1Data`).
- **INI rows:** BFME1's extra rows are registered per table (`RegisterBfme1FieldRows`) and found only in BFME1 data; RotWK's tables stay
  the binary's, so RotWK data still fails on these fields as retail does. Value-level differences (AudioEvent `Control` names, special power
  `Enum` names, particle priorities, OCL dispositions, command points) ask `INI::bfme1Data()`.
- **Simulation:** differences ask the template (`ThingTemplate::bfme1Data()`, set by a ThingFactory built for BFME1 data): the vision default,
  build plots under their occupant, the castle flags. A RotWK game's state hash and saves are unchanged.
- **Files read through a file system ask that file system:** map chunks (`MapReadOptions::bfme1`, set by every map / base / library reader
  from its file system), the map cache, and the W3D model and texture layout (`W3DFileSource::FlatAssetLayout`, `Resolve_W3D_Texture`'s
  `flatLayout`), which the simulation's asset manager (launch bones) also reads.
- **Client paths with nothing to ask** (the texture decoder's PNG / JPEG sniffing, the Apt VM's type-8 constants, floor picking) ask
  `bfme1Mounted()`, set by the BFME1 mount once its archives pass `isBfme1Data` and cleared otherwise. It never decides a game rule.
- What BFME1 mode infers rather than ports is stop **S-5017** ([STOPS.md](STOPS.md)), in the BFME1 mount's report.

## How the BFME1 data differs

These are the places where BFME1's data or menus differ from RotWK's. Each one is handled when the BFME1 archives are mounted
(`isBfme1Data`, `Common/BfmeGame.h`: `SubsystemLegend.ini` without
`SubsystemLegendExpansion1.ini` or `AwardSystem.ini`):

- **Models and textures** are flat: `art\w3d\<name>.w3d` and `art\textures\<name>.dds`, with no two-letter folders
  (`W3D_Set_Flat_Asset_Layout`, set by the mount).
- **Command points:** GameData has `GoodCommandPointsMP56` / `MP78` (5–6 and 7–8 players), not one row per count
  (Open-BFME-1 `Player_newMap.cpp`).
- **AIData has no `DeepWaterDepth`, and GameData has no `MaxCells*` pathfinder limits.** BFME1 compiles its limits in:
  5000 cells per frame, 400 adjust tries, 2000 patch path cells, 2500 attack path cells, and 30000 cell infos
  (Open-BFME-1 `AIPathfind.cpp`). INFERENCE: the horde-melee, melee-engagement, possible-destination and towards-goal
  budgets have no located constant, so they keep RotWK 2.01's values.
- **Script libraries** use `MPPositionInfo` version 0: the two flags and the team, with no LoadAIScript flag and no
  side restrictions.
- **Victory:** GameData has no `VictoryCondition*ObjectFilter` rows. INFERENCE: a base is a `STRUCTURE` that is not
  `IGNORE_FOR_VICTORY`, and an army is any unit that is not a `DOZER` (the compiled rule isn't in Open-BFME-1).
- **Vision defaults:** an omitted `ShroudClearingRange` defaults to `VisionRange`, as in Open-BFME-1 `Object.cpp`.
  Gondor's keep relies on this; treating it as zero hid the keep and castle floor behind shroud.
- **Last map:** selecting a skirmish map immediately saves the current profile's lobby. The preferred map is restored
  even when the remaining saved lobby settings cannot be reused.
- **Start castles:** a match starts with each player's castle standing. INFERENCE: a castle flag that uses
  `UseTheNewCastleSystemInsteadOfTheClunkyBuildList` (no RotWK castle has that row), and whose owner's faction has a
  `CastleToUnpackForFaction` entry, unpacks that castle at once and for free on its first update. Neutral flags keep
  the normal unpack price. The retail trigger (the caller of `CastleBehavior::initiateUnpack`) isn't in Open-BFME-1.
- **Castle layouts:** BFME1's new castle system places its authored layout without per-piece overlap checks;
  adjacent wall and gate geometry deliberately overlaps. Applying the RotWK placement check drops those pieces.
- **Occupied plots:** starting construction hides and deselects a regular build plot, closing its commands. The plot returns when its occupant is removed.
- **Ground texture alpha:** JPEG ground textures take priority over paired PNG alpha masks and load their alpha through the same packed-texture merge used by the UI.
- **Build-plot picking:** plot surfaces use `W3DFloorDraw`, so mouse picking tests their visible floor triangles
  as well as scripted model draws. Hidden floors remain unpickable.
- **Skirmish maps:** the lobby lists the mapcache's multiplayer maps, as for RotWK (Sol review r1: no file-name filter; in BFME1 1.03 every
  multiplayer entry is a `map mp` map with two or more players).
- **Texture replacements:** PNG/JPEG files are accepted by BFME1 texture lookup (including `GBCampFloor`), and image signatures are recognized even when replacements retain `.dds` filenames.
- **Palantir commands:** BFME1 uses six fixed `CommandButtons.Command1` … `Command6` slots and `SetCommandButtonState`, rather than BFME2's dynamic content frames. Slot state updates only run when content changes, so show animations can finish.
- **Command tooltips:** BFME1's legacy cursor blocks are skipped to their `End` when loading help fonts. A native help panel displays the existing command-help text because BFME1 has no BFME2 `OnHelpBoxLoaded` content-frame callback.
- **Pause menu:** BFME1 uses type-8 `PushData` constants to reference the active constant pool. Resolving these initializes each button's own text and callback, including the Restart/Exit confirmations.
- **Keys and voices:** only `Data\INI\CommandMap.ini` exists (there's no root `CommandMap.ini`), and there's no
  `CrowdResponse.ini`, because BFME1 has no crowd responses.
- **Main menu:** `MainMenu.apt` shows its menu bar only when `ShowMainMenu()` is called. INFERENCE: BFME1's
  `OnInitialized` makes that call (Open-BFME-1 declares `_bfme_onInitialized` without its body). Its button instance
  names don't match the buttons: the clip named `Skirmish` is the Campaign button, and `Tutorial` is Skirmish. Scripts
  find buttons by their `buttonName` label (`$SoloPlay`, `$Skirmish`), as a player does.
- **Skirmish lobby:** `Skirmish.apt` opens with `OpenDefault`, its persona popup opens with `PopUpPersona` and closes
  with `PopUpControl("close")`, and it sends `Skirmish::PersonaAccept` / `PersonaCancel` / `PersonaRemove` /
  `PersonaOk`. The Start button is `bottomNav.StartGame`.

## Limits

This is not yet a complete or retail-compatible BFME1 implementation. The shared
simulation still has unported modules, and BFME1-specific castle, horde, audio,
and combat behavior needs further comparison with the original game. Legacy
fields that lack runtime consumers are retained rather than discarded.
BFME1 particle priorities currently map to the shared renderer's quality tiers;
its original particle budget is not reproduced. One shipped unresolved mounted
Faramir voice reference (`UnitSpecificSounds` `VoiceGarrison = FaramirKnightVoiceGarrison`, which no AudioEvent defines) loads as BFME1 loads
it: BFME1's `UnitSpecificSounds` lines store the event name without looking it up (Open-BFME-1 `ThingTemplate_parseArbitrarySoundsIntoMap.cpp`).

The Living World Good/Evil campaigns and their saves are not implemented. Their
menu requests display the existing unavailable-screen message instead of trying
to start a BFME2 linear campaign. BFME1 currently uses the English language view.

## Checks

Synthetic CSF tests are included in `openbfme_tests --test-case="GameText:*"`.
Run `engine/build/openbfme_tests --test-case="GameText:*"` from the checkout
root on Linux after building the core tests (Windows: `engine\build\openbfme_tests.exe`
with the same argument). No retail data is needed for these synthetic tests.
The following **Linux/macOS POSIX-shell** checks use the editor binary, not an
export template, and require the built extension and BFME1 data described above.
The installed-data smoke test is:

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="$PWD/games/BFME1" godot --headless --path godot \
  --script res://tests/bfme1_test.gd
```

It checks object loading, the real main menu and Skirmish shell, and a
Gondor-versus-Mordor Fords of Isen game. It prints `BFME1 SKIP` and exits 0
when `BFME1_INSTALL` is unset; that exit is not a passed installed-data test.

The whole launch, scripted with real mouse events (main menu → Solo Play → Skirmish → persona → Start → 10 s of play):

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="$PWD/games/BFME1" godot --headless --path godot -- --game=bfme1 --auto --check --advance=10 \
  "--map=maps/map mp fords of isen/map mp fords of isen.map" --faction=FactionGondor
```

`godot/tests/bfme1_quit_test.gd` checks the camp-floor material and all six pause-menu buttons with real movie clicks, including confirmations.
