# BFME1 support

BFME1 is an experimental, separate game mode. It uses a BFME1 installation for
both menus and gameplay, without mixing in BFME2 or RotWK data.

Build the extension normally, then launch:

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="/path/to/BFME1" godot --path godot -- --game=bfme1
```

Alternatively pass `--bfme1-install=/path/to/BFME1` alongside `--game=bfme1`.
The installation must contain its BIG archives, including `apt` and `lang`.
Installed patch archives are included in BFME1 archive order; launcher-generated
`!!!` graphics overrides are excluded. This mode fingerprints the installed
archives for content identity, but does not certify them against a retail 1.03
manifest. The existing RotWK verification policy is unchanged.

The launcher offers **Battle for Middle-earth I** in the Play screen's game selector.
Its **Game files → Download** action includes BFME1 1.03 (`original-BFME1`),
installed into `<download folder>/BFME1`. The launcher records `BFME1_INSTALL`
in `downloaded-installs.cfg` and passes the asset folder when starting BFME1;
no copy into the application bundle is needed. An existing macOS AIO installation
is also detected. The command-line equivalent is `--game=bfme1 --play` on the
launcher; the selection persists. Downloads retain per-file MD5 and size checks.

BFME1 has separate `bfme1-Options.ini` and `bfme1-Skirmish.ini` settings.
`--game=bfme1` and `--bfme1-install=...` are normal player options, so profiles persist between launches.
Automation flags such as `--auto` still use an isolated temporary profile file.
Its archive fingerprint cache is `bfme1-archive-cache.cfg` in the user data folder.

## Source and implementation

The donor checkout is `../Open-BFME-1` (inspected at `77b050212e`). Relevant sources:

- `game/GameEngineDevice/Source/Win32Device/Common/Win32BIGFileSystem_loadBigFiles.cpp`:
  descending archive order, first archive wins.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/GameClient/GameText.cpp`, `parseCSF` at `0x00437570`:
  complemented UTF-16 strings, first string per label, optional voice records.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/GameClient/GUI/AptMainMenuConstructor.cpp` and
  `BfmeAptScreenMainMenuProvider.cpp`: BFME1 menu commands and providers.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/Common/Thing/ThingTemplate.cpp` and
  `GameClient/Drawable/Behavior/RandomSoundSelectorFieldParse.cpp`:
  legacy object and voice fields.
- `game/GameEngine/Source/Common/INI/INIAudioSettings.cpp` and
  `GameClient/Eva.cpp`: BFME1 audio settings and predefined EVA names.

The shared engine reads BFME1's subsystem legend and omits expansion-only
Stances/Create-a-Hero initialization. Language files under `lang/english` are
exposed at the root, as expected by existing menu readers. Both the shell and
in-game text consumers understand CSF.

## How the BFME1 data differs

These are the places where BFME1's data or menus differ from RotWK's. Each one is handled when the BFME1 archives are mounted
(`isBfme1Data`, `Common/BfmeGame.h`: `SubsystemLegend.ini` without `SubsystemLegendExpansion1.ini`):

- **Models and textures** are flat: `art\w3d\<name>.w3d` and `art\textures\<name>.dds`, with no two-letter folders
  (`W3D_Set_Flat_Asset_Layout`, set by the mount).
- **Command points:** GameData has `GoodCommandPointsMP56` / `MP78` (5–6 and 7–8 players), not one row per count
  (Open-BFME-1 `Player_newMap.cpp`).
- **AIData has no `DeepWaterDepth`, and GameData has no `MaxCells*` pathfinder limits.** BFME1 compiles its limits in:
  5000 cells per frame, 400 adjust tries, 2000 patch path cells, 2500 attack path cells, and 30000 cell infos
  (Open-BFME-1 `AIPathfind.cpp`). INFERENCE: the horde-melee, melee-engagement, possible-destination and towards-goal
  budgets have no located constant, so they keep RotWK 2.01's values.
- **Script libraries** use `MPPositionInfo` version 0: the two flags and the team, with no LoadAIScript flag and no
  side restrictions.
- **Victory:** GameData has no `VictoryCondition*ObjectFilter` rows. INFERENCE: a base is a `STRUCTURE` that is not
  `IGNORE_FOR_VICTORY`, and an army is any unit that is not a `DOZER` (the compiled rule isn't in Open-BFME-1).
- **Vision defaults:** an omitted `ShroudClearingRange` defaults to `VisionRange`, as in Open-BFME-1 `Object.cpp`.
  Gondor's keep relies on this; treating it as zero hid the keep and castle floor behind shroud.
- **Last map:** selecting a skirmish map immediately saves the current profile's lobby. The preferred map is restored
  even when the remaining saved lobby settings cannot be reused.
- **Start castles:** a match starts with each player's castle standing. INFERENCE: a castle flag that uses
  `UseTheNewCastleSystemInsteadOfTheClunkyBuildList` (no RotWK castle has that row), and whose owner's faction has a
  `CastleToUnpackForFaction` entry, unpacks that castle at once and for free on its first update. Neutral flags keep
  the normal unpack price. The retail trigger (the caller of `CastleBehavior::initiateUnpack`) isn't in Open-BFME-1.
- **Castle layouts:** BFME1's new castle system places its authored layout without per-piece overlap checks;
  adjacent wall and gate geometry deliberately overlaps. Applying the RotWK placement check drops those pieces.
- **Occupied plots:** starting construction hides and deselects a regular build plot, closing its commands. The plot returns when its occupant is removed.
- **Ground texture alpha:** JPEG ground textures take priority over paired PNG alpha masks and load their alpha through the same packed-texture merge used by the UI.
- **Build-plot picking:** plot surfaces use `W3DFloorDraw`, so mouse picking tests their visible floor triangles
  as well as scripted model draws. Hidden floors remain unpickable.
- **Skirmish maps:** the lobby lists multiplayer `map mp` entries with at least two players, excluding the
  `test`/`nctest` utility maps. Patch 2.22 also marks co-op campaigns and utility maps as multiplayer;
  those stay loadable by name but are omitted from the skirmish list.
- **Texture replacements:** PNG/JPEG files are accepted by BFME1 texture lookup (including `GBCampFloor`), and image signatures are recognized even when replacements retain `.dds` filenames.
- **Palantir commands:** BFME1 uses six fixed `CommandButtons.Command1` … `Command6` slots and `SetCommandButtonState`, rather than BFME2's dynamic content frames. Slot state updates only run when content changes, so show animations can finish.
- **Command tooltips:** BFME1's legacy cursor blocks are skipped to their `End` when loading help fonts. A native help panel displays the existing command-help text because BFME1 has no BFME2 `OnHelpBoxLoaded` content-frame callback.
- **Pause menu:** BFME1 uses type-8 `PushData` constants to reference the active constant pool. Resolving these initializes each button's own text and callback, including the Restart/Exit confirmations.
- **Keys and voices:** only `Data\INI\CommandMap.ini` exists (there's no root `CommandMap.ini`), and there's no
  `CrowdResponse.ini`, because BFME1 has no crowd responses.
- **Main menu:** `MainMenu.apt` shows its menu bar only when `ShowMainMenu()` is called. INFERENCE: BFME1's
  `OnInitialized` makes that call (Open-BFME-1 declares `_bfme_onInitialized` without its body). Its button instance
  names don't match the buttons: the clip named `Skirmish` is the Campaign button, and `Tutorial` is Skirmish. Scripts
  find buttons by their `buttonName` label (`$SoloPlay`, `$Skirmish`), as a player does.
- **Skirmish lobby:** `Skirmish.apt` opens with `OpenDefault`, its persona popup opens with `PopUpPersona` and closes
  with `PopUpControl("close")`, and it sends `Skirmish::PersonaAccept` / `PersonaCancel` / `PersonaRemove` /
  `PersonaOk`. The Start button is `bottomNav.StartGame`.

## Limits

This is not yet a complete or retail-compatible BFME1 implementation. The shared
simulation still has unported modules, and BFME1-specific castle, horde, audio,
and combat behavior needs further comparison with the original game. Legacy
fields that lack runtime consumers are retained rather than discarded.
BFME1 particle priorities currently map to the shared renderer's quality tiers;
its original particle budget is not reproduced. One shipped unresolved mounted
Faramir voice reference is retained and logged instead of aborting object loading.

The Living World Good/Evil campaigns and their saves are not implemented. Their
menu requests display the existing unavailable-screen message instead of trying
to start a BFME2 linear campaign. BFME1 currently uses the English language view.

## Checks

Synthetic CSF tests are included in `openbfme_tests --test-case='GameText:*'`.
The installed-data smoke test is:

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="/path/to/BFME1" godot --headless --path godot \
  --script res://tests/bfme1_test.gd
```

It checks object loading, the real main menu and Skirmish shell, and a
Gondor-versus-Mordor Fords of Isen game. It skips when `BFME1_INSTALL` is unset.

The whole launch, scripted with real mouse events (main menu → Solo Play → Skirmish → persona → Start → 10 s of play):

```sh
BFME1_INSTALL="/path/to/BFME1" godot --headless --path godot -- --game=bfme1 --auto --check --advance=10 \
  "--map=maps/map mp fords of isen/map mp fords of isen.map" --faction=FactionGondor
```

`godot/tests/bfme1_quit_test.gd` checks the camp-floor material and all six pause-menu buttons with real movie clicks, including confirmations.
